one of requiremens for naming should be simplicity of searching, try to search >>= or >=> and find a relevant documentation.

snake_case over camelCase as some of semantics can be lost
my fav is dashed-case but it suffers from searchibility

is_flag over flag?
my fav is with ? but I had a lot of questions what the meaning of it and plus it is not "internet search friendly"
